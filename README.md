# Cowley Pottery: 

This website is being designed for use by Cowley Pottery, the pottery shop of Helen Taylor.

This website is unfinished, unpolished and undeployed! I became (delightfully) employed at the crunch time of this project and my priorities had to shift. I'm aware that this is not enough to pass but I would be really grateful for some feedback on the direction that this is going in, as the base layout, colour scheme and functionality will all be used in the final deployment. Thank you very much for your time :)

One obstacle I had not anticipated when facing a sprint to the finish was how much the customer would affect the speed. The "customer" is my mother and I'm still waiting on information and images she wants in her site and over the next month I will be taking these matters into my own hands when I return home for Christmas :) 


This website has been created as the Fifth Milestone project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Diploma. It was built using a Full-Stack Toolkit, with the addition of E-commerce Applications such as Stripe. GitPod was used for writing the code for this website, as well as committing and pushing to GitHub. GitHub was then used to store the project after it had been pushed from GitPod. Once all the code had been written, Heroku was then used to deploy the website.

## Site Goals:

The goals for this site are as follows:
* Allow users to view products
* Allow users to add products to a basket
* Allow users to update or delete products from basket
* Allow users to make payments using Stripe
* Allow users to create a user profile
* Allow users to contact the store with any queries 
* Allow user to request commissions 
* Allow users to sign up for a stock newsletter
* Allow authorised users to leave product reviews
* Allow store owner to collect user data to complete orders
* Allow store owners to approve user reviews 


## UX:

### User stories: 

The user stories are on the projects board and I will copy them over to here at a later date. I have been using Excel to maintain the Moscow working method as I find that GitHub is clunky for a 1 man team. 
#### Epics

* Views and Navigation

## Development Planes:
To create a website that is comprehensive and informative for a user, as a developer you need to look at all aspects of the website and how someone who visits your website will use it. You have to consider all the user stories that have been outlined in the above sections.  

## Strategy
The strategy principle looks at user needs, as well as product/service objectives. This website's target audience was broken down into three categories:
### Roles: 
* Admin
* New User
* Existing User  

### Demographic:
* Aged between 18 to 100

#### Lifestyle:
* Collectors
* Home Decorators
* Hobbyists


#### The website needs to allow users to:  
* View products by price, category or rating
* Add products to a basket
* Edit product quantities and delete products straight from the basket
* Make secure payments for their products via credit card
* Create a user profile
* Contact the store with enquiries
* Sign up for a newsletter
* Leave reviews for products they bought
* Visit the store's social media accounts straight from the site 

#### The website needs to allow the store owner to:  
* Add, edit and delete products straight from the frontend site 
* Collect information from order forms
* Collect email addresses for a monthly marketing newsletter


## Scope:  

With the structure in place, it was then time to move onto the scope plane. This was all about developing website requirements based on the goals set out in the strategy plane. These requirements are broken down into two categories. 

### Content Requirements:
1. The user will be looking for:
      * A list of products that can be purchased 
      * Information about the store owner
      * Links to the store's social media accounts

### Functionality Requirements:
1. The user will be able to:
      * Learn more about the store and the owner
      * Browse all the store's products
      * Add products to a basket
      * Edit their basket
      * Complete orders using Stripe
      * Create a user account
      * Update information on a user account
      * Contact the store with enquires 
      * Sign up for a newsletter
      * Request a specific commision
      * Learn more about the store and the owner

## Skeleton:
Wireframes were created to set out the initial appearance of the website while also making sure to keep the end-user in mind at all times. Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).  

## Surface:

***


### Colour: 
The colours used for this project were white and a grey that looks just like unfired clay! Not only in this in keeping with the product, it matches up with the general approach accross hobbyist websites which generally follow a light coloured clean and simple approach.


### Font:
Fonts used for this site were Chelsea Market and Varta, both of which have been imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

Note the "Logo" is currently shown in Rampart One but this is a place holder as the customer is looking to get a graphic designer to create an actual logo.

### Images:
The images for this project are all genuine pieces from the story either taken by me or by the customer.

Please note the landing page is also placeholder as this will be replaced by a nice, high resolution image or better (if I can find the equipment necessary) a 10 second repeating video of potters wheel rotating with clay on top from a vertical perspective.

## Features:
There are several features on this site to help users get the most out of their visit to the site.  

### General:

&nbsp;

### Landing page:

&nbsp;

### Home page:


&nbsp;

### Shop page:  

Here the filtering of products is done through tiles rather than outdated dropdowns.

There is a new filter which returns products that have only been added the database within a certain timeframe.

Note that due to the nature of this website, there is little need for a search bar as at any given time there will only be a handful of items on sale. 

There has been extra functionality added to only be able to buy what is it stock.

Note also when an item runs out of stock, it will remain on the website with a banner (to be added) until it is taken down intentionally. This is to give prospective buyers an idea for commissions as opposed to thinking they cannot purchase
