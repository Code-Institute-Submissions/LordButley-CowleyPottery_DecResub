                I was late coming to the pottery party. It was first suggested to me as a new hobby by my daughter
                whilst
                she was at university - I was finding the empty nest hard to deal with. Rather than try pottery I
                decided to
                travel and spent several years seeing the world. This all came to a crashing halt with Covid. Then a
                chance
                sighting of an advert for pottery classes peaked my interest. I signed up and had the good fortune of
                meeting my friend
                Jane who took me through the basics of wheel throwing and hand building. At the end of 6 weeks of
                classes - 2
                weeks on the wheel, 2 weeks hand building and 2 weeks glazing - I was beginning to think "I can do
                this" so I
                signed up for another 6 weeks! Things moved at a pace after that. My husband built me a studio, I bought
                a
                wheel and a kiln and started my obsession with clay.

                Cowley pottery is my studio in beautiful East Devon. I take my inspiration from the rolling green
                countryside and the glorious beaches. Organic and altered forms. I love wheel throwing, seeing how far I
                can
                take the clay and I am always striving to become better.
